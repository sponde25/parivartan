### Description
Our team is building a tool to fight the Global Warming and Greenhouse Effect by training a recommender engine to recommend tasks to the users. The tasks would be calibrated to maximize the impact of each task while keeping in mind the user's preference and convenience. The primary purpose of this tool will be to minimize greenhouse emission on a user-by-user level to cut down the biggest non-industrial production of global warming without the need of major expenditure and fewer lifestyle changes. The highly optimized recommender engine chooses tasks from a wide database and also keeps track of impact till date.
